# t5_distillation

This is an attempt to distill a pretrained `t5-base` (more specifically [this one](https://huggingface.co/mrm8488/t5-base-finetuned-imdb-sentiment)) into a `t5-small`. It's the final assignment for the IA376-I course that I took at [FEEC -Unicamp](https://www.fee.unicamp.br/)

It contains a notebook with experiments as well as two small, simple scripts that I used to generate some examples.
